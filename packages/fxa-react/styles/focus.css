/* This class is a baseline styling for the "focus" interactive state shared

 * outline-offset, etc) applied elsewhere.
 * Design document for reference: https://www.figma.com/design/2ruSnPauajQGprFy6K333u
 * NOTE: Using focus-visible instead of focus here because focus-visible is only
 * triggered when navigating with keyboard, while focus is also triggered by
 * mouse press, which is not the desired behavior for button-like components. */
