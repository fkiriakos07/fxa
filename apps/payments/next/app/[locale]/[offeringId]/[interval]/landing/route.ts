 * This landing route will initiate the OAuth no prompt signin
 * attempt with FxA.
 *
 * Only when an unexpected error occurs, will the user be redirected
 * to a generic error page.
 *
 * On successful authentication, the customer will be redirected
 * to the /new page in a "Signed In" state. (i.e. FxA uid added to cart)
 *
 * On failure the customer will be redirected to /error/auth/signin
 * where the error will be handled correctly, and ideally redirect
 * the customer to the /new page in a "Signed Out" state. (i.e. no
 * FxA uid added to the cart)
 *
 * This needs to be a route handler, since the `signIn` server
 * action needs to be executed from a route handler.
