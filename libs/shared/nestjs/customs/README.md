# Customs

This library supports adding customs (i.e. rate-limiting) as a nestjs service. It was initially designed to work with
FxA's graphql-api, but could be repurposed to work else where.

## Building

Run `nx build customs` to build the library.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test-unit customs` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
